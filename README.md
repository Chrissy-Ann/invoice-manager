# Invoice Manager
- Task: Use PHP templates and provided invoice data to create a multipage site that displays invoice data in a list.


1. What challenges did you face in completing this assignment?
There was a bit of a learning curve about using templates and adding them to each page. Sometimes I wasn't sure whether I should assign a variable from the template before or after I included the template page. I also had some trouble remembering to close loops and if statements with the endforeach; and endif; statements when using colons instead of curly braces.

2. What did you find most interesting about creating PHP templates?
I thought it was interesting being able to organize a project into many different pages to keep things neat, and be able to include data from one page in another. It's a bit similar to creating different files for components like we did with Blazor.

3. How does PHP differ from other programming languages you have used?
It was hard for me to remember to add the endif; and endforeach; statements, which is something I've never had to use in any other language. It was also different having to keep closing the php tag before including some html, because with razor syntax there's the @ symbol for C#, but there's nothing to close it. It was a bit weird having to open and close the php tag multiple times in the same loop.
