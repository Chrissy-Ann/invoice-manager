# Invoice Manager
- Task: Add the ability to upload and view PDF versions of an invoice.

1. What additional code would be required for the Invoice Manager application to accept multiple different file types?

- To accept multiple file types, the input tag for the file would have to be changed. In the input tag, the accept attribute would be adjusted, adding more file extension types in a comma-separated list, like ".pdf, .jpg". If what was wanted was any file type of a certain media, there is also "images/*", "audio/*" and "video/*". This allows for any file type of that kind of media, such as all image files.

2. How would you improve the Invoice Manager application? What new features would you add or improve?

- I would improve the application by adding a search function, allowing to search by client name, and a sort feature to sort client names alphabetically. These features would make finding a particular invoice easier. 

3. What have you learned from completing the Invoice Manager application? How will those skills help you in the future?

- I've learned how to connect a php application to a database, ways to handle data arrays, and ways to set up CRUD operations with php. These skills can be applied to many if not most projects I might work on in the future. They are basic skills with many applications.
